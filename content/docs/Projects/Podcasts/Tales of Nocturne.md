# Tales of Nocturne

_Night Time Fantasy Fiction Podcast.Â [New Episodes Every Full-Moon(ish)](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/full-moon-calendar)._Â   

I use podcasts to help me fall asleep. This works well for me but often there is loud music, adverts, or even just sensitive topics that can keep me awake. I had also tried dedicated sleep podcasts but found the content too disinteresting to habitually listen to. So I madeÂ _Tales of Nocturne_Â to ride the line between sleep-enabling and engaging.

Our stories follow the lives of those who live on Nocturne, the planet of eternal night surrounded by a multitude of magical waltzing moons. Within the Midnight City and without in the Farwilds, we discover the rites of the Lunar Priests with Neven; the secrets of Songlight with Yuki and her lab; the inner workings of the Historians Guild; and the eccentric and erratic researchers of the Society Royal.Â 

So relax as they explore their world and let you rest in yours. Sweet dreams. ðŸŒ•
