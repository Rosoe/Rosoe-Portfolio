# Difficulty Fingerprinting Framework
Difficulty Fingerprinting is a framework for helping game designers, researchers, and players understand the difficulty of a game by focusing on the fundamental human capabilities and responses that games test, rather than specific mechanics or genres. By focusing on player responses rather than game features, we can create a robust model that adapts to any type of game challenge.
## The Framework
You can the user guide and framework here on it's github page. I welcome comments, criticism, and contributions to the framework as long as they fit within the limited scope of the framework:

## The Visualiser
Additionally, I created a difficulty fingerprinting visualiser so you can easily analyse and describe games using the framework. The visualiser is completely editable, so if you hate the framework or want to tailor it to a specific game (or if you just need a cool wheel visualisation) then you can change it.
