Release Date: April 2024
## Summary
Tann, the maker of Slice and Dice (available on [itch.io](https://tann.itch.io/slice-dice), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1775490/Slice__Dice/), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slice-dice/id6449848963), and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.com.tann.dice&hl=en&pli=1)), asked me to produce a track for the 3.0 update of the game. This was a huge update that introduced many elements that the games fans had been asking for; one of which being music to accompany the game.

Having been a fan of the game before working on the music for it, I always felt the vibe of S&D was tough but fun. The track I produced for it would need to inhabit both those world - a bit of seriousness with strokes of lightheartedness. 

Tann and I went back and forth on how intense the track could be, with me wanting to incorporate more powerful elements into the track but Tann wanted to maintain the more laidback vibes of the game. We also had some practical imitations for what could be made using the in-game music system. The track needed to be <120 seconds to maintain the small file size of the game and accommodate some of the difficult looping issues that need to be worked around on the android version of the game.

All this resulted in *Swiftsoles*! If you want to listen, check out Slice and Dice [Demo on Itch.io](https://tann.itch.io/slice-dice) and consider buying the game on whichever platform you enjoy most!
