# Slice and Dice
*Status: Complete*
Release Date: April 2024
## Summary
Tann, the maker of Slice and Dice (available on [itch.io](https://tann.itch.io/slice-dice) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1775490/Slice__Dice/)), asked me to produce a track for the 3.0 update of the game. This was a huge update that introduced many elements that the games fans had been asking for; one of which being music to accompany the game.
